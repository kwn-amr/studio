## Core Features:

- Field Selection: Allow users to select from a predefined list of common fields (e.g., Science, Humanities, Engineering) to populate the subject tree.
- Custom Field Input: Enable users to input a custom field of study, in addition to the predefined options.
- Dynamic Graph Generation: Automatically generate a tree graph of subjects using Cerebras inference, with the selected or inputted field as the root, sub-disciplines as branches, and specific topics as leaves.
- Interactive Node Details: Provide interactive nodes within the tree graph that display additional details upon click or hover.
- Expandable Branches: Implement functionality to expand and collapse branches of the tree, allowing users to focus on specific areas of interest.
- Zoom and Pan: Incorporate zoom and pan capabilities to enable users to navigate the tree graph effectively.
- Graph Export: Implement export functionality, allowing users to download the graph as an image or a JSON data file. The AI acts as a tool that incorporates the field selected.

- Accent color: A calm blue (#76A0F2), for interactive elements and highlights.
- Use clear, modern sans-serif fonts for readability and a clean user experience.
- Maintain a clean and intuitive layout, ensuring easy navigation and interaction with the subject tree graph.
- Employ simple, visually consistent icons for key actions like expanding/collapsing branches and exporting the graph.
- Incorporate subtle animations to enhance user interaction, such as smooth transitions when expanding or collapsing branches.
